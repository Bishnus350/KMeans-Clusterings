# KMeans-Clusterings
- This is a simple tutorial on using KMeans Clustering in IRIS datasets. As ML is getting more popular day by day, I upload the simplest ML programming, using KMeans clustering
for clustering IRIS datasets. I would like the potential reader that, try to find extra study material along with coding. Once you gain knowledge of the algorithm (How, Why, How) you can design any program. 
- The IRIS dataset is one of the popular datasets used to learn clustering.
- Some terms like MixmaxScaler, and DBSCAN may be new for some learners. Again instruction is to go to Google and read them once. 
- I typed my script in VScode and the file is in extension'.py'. For the user in 'Jupyter Notebook' make the extension '.ipynb'
